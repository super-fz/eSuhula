Seniors, the digitally illiterate, and people of determination still continue to face challenges when trying to access digital government services through a smart device, since they tend to require assistance when navigating through apps. 

eSuhula is a platform that eliminates the concept of long queues for digitally illiterate, problems of ending up at the wrong government offices for assistance, and accessibility issues. 

It consists of an AI-powered virtual assistant "Noura", which can accept prompts through text, voice, and sign language inputs. It also features a pre-filled ad watered-down interface in its forms to minimize UI complexity for seniors and people with limited intellectual capabilities, reducing the number of steps required to complete a service from 4 to 3.

This solution has been designed in response to one of the challenges featured in the UAE hackathon 2024:

**"How can the performance of government employees in serving the citizens of Ajman be improved through the use of Artificial Intelligence?"**
